```

#### Option 2: Config File (Permanent)

```bash
# Edit the config file created by track-manager init
# Location: ~/.config/track-manager/config.yaml

## Configuration

Track Manager uses sensible defaults. The config file is created automatically when you run `track-manager init`.

Config location: `~/.config/track-manager/config.yaml`

You can customize:

- Output directory
- Download format preferences (M4A, MP3)
- Duplicate handling behavior
- Spotify credentials
- And more...

See `config.example.yaml` for all available options.

## Audio Quality

Track Manager always downloads at the **best available quality** - no configuration needed.

### Quality by Source

| Source          | Format   | Bitrate               | Notes                              |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Spotify**     | MP3/M4A  | 320 kbps / 256 kbps   | Highest quality available          |
| **YouTube**     | Opus/M4A | ~160 kbps / ~128 kbps | Best audio stream (format 251/140) |
| **SoundCloud**  | Various  | Best available        | Uses same settings as YouTube      |
| **Direct URLs** | Original | Preserved             | No re-encoding                     |

### Technical Details

- **Spotify**: Uses spotdl with `bitrate: "320k"` setting

  - MP3: 320 kbps constant bitrate
  - M4A/AAC: 256 kbps (comparable quality to 320 kbps MP3)

- **YouTube**: Explicitly requests high-quality audio formats

  - Format 251: Opus codec at ~160 kbps (preferred)
  - Format 140: M4A/AAC at ~128 kbps (fallback)
  - Avoids low-quality formats (249: ~50 kbps)

- **SoundCloud**: Inherits YouTube's format selection
  - Best available quality from source

### Why These Quality Levels?

- **320 kbps MP3** is considered "transparent" (indistinguishable from source)
- **256 kbps AAC/M4A** is roughly equivalent to 320 kbps MP3 due to better compression
- **160 kbps Opus** is highly efficient, comparable to 256 kbps MP3
- Higher bitrates waste storage without audible quality improvement

### Quality vs File Size

Approximate file sizes for a 4-minute track:

- 320 kbps MP3: ~10 MB
- 256 kbps M4A: ~8 MB
- 160 kbps Opus: ~5 MB
- 128 kbps M4A: ~4 MB

## Duplicate Detection

Track Manager intelligently detects duplicates by:

- Comparing artist + title from ID3/M4A tags (not filenames)
- Normalizing metadata (removes "[Official Video]", handles "feat." variations)
- Working across formats (finds M4A duplicates of MP3 files)
- Case-insensitive matching

When a duplicate is found, you'll be prompted to:

- Skip new file (keep existing)
- Keep both files
- Replace existing with new file

## Metadata Management

When metadata is missing or problematic, tracks are flagged for manual review:

1. Download script flags tracks with issues
2. Edit `tracks-metadata-review.csv` to fill in correct metadata
3. Run `track-manager apply-metadata` to update files

## Error Handling

Failed downloads are logged to `failed-downloads.txt` with timestamps and error messages. You can retry failed URLs later.

## Troubleshooting

### Spotify Downloads

**Problem:** "Error: No Spotify credentials found"

**Solution:** Spotify downloads require API credentials. See the [Spotify Setup](#spotify-setup-optional) section above for detailed instructions.

Quick fix:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"

# Or edit config file
nano ~/.config/track-manager/config.yaml
```

Get credentials from: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard

### Low Quality Downloads

**Problem:** Old tracks downloaded at 128 kbps or lower

**Solution:** The quality fix was implemented in version 0.2.0. If you have old low-quality tracks:

1. Check library quality: Look for tracks < 128 kbps using your audio player's metadata view
2. Re-download those tracks - they'll now download at best quality
3. Remove old low-quality versions

**Note:** Quality is now always best by default. You don't need to configure anything.

### YouTube Download Issues

**Problem:** "Error: Unable to extract video info"

**Possible causes:**

- Video is private or removed
- Video is age-restricted
- Geo-restricted content
- YouTube rate limiting

**Solution:**

- Verify the URL is correct and accessible in a browser
- Wait a few minutes and retry (rate limiting)
- Check `failed-downloads.txt` for specific error messages

### SoundCloud Issues

**Problem:** Downloads fail or get low quality

**Solution:**

- SoundCloud requires the track to be publicly accessible
- Private tracks or sets cannot be downloaded
- Some tracks may have download disabled by the artist

### Metadata Issues

**Problem:** Tracks have incorrect or missing metadata

**Solution:**

1. Check `tracks-metadata-review.csv` in your output directory
2. Fill in correct artist and title for flagged tracks
3. Run: `track-manager apply-metadata`

### Duplicate Detection

**Problem:** Duplicate detection not working

**Possible causes:**

- Files have no metadata (artist/title tags missing)
- Metadata is very different between files

**Solution:**

- Ensure files have proper ID3/M4A tags
- Use `track-manager apply-metadata` to fix metadata first
- Duplicate detection compares artist + title from tags, not filenames

### Installation Issues

**Problem:** "Command not found: track-manager"

**Solution:**

```bash
# Ensure installation directory is in PATH
pip show track-manager  # Check installation location

# Or use as module
python -m track_manager download <url>
```

**Problem:** Missing dependencies

**Solution:**

```bash
# Run setup check
track-manager check-setup

# Install missing dependencies
pip install track-manager[dev]  # Includes all optional deps
```

### Getting Help

If you encounter other issues:

1. Check `failed-downloads.txt` for error details
2. Run `track-manager check-setup` to verify installation
3. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/AmalganOpen/track-manager/issues)
4. Open a new issue with:
   - Command you ran
   - Full error message
   - Output of `track-manager check-setup`
